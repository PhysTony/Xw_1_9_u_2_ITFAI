We've gotten a lot of questions about whether this course teaches TensorFlow 2.0 or 1.x.

The answer is: Both!

We've designed the curriculum for the early modules in this course to have code that's generic
enough that it works with both versions, so you are welcome to try it with the 2.0 alpha. If you
are using the colabs, you'll use the latest version of TensorFlow that Google Colaboratory supports,
which, at time of writing is 1.13. You can replace this with 2.0 by adding a codeblock containing:

!pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0 

...and you should be able to use TF2.0 alpha if you like!
Later modules may use specific versions of libraries, some of which may require TF2.0, and we will
note them when you get there!
